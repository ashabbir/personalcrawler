She first published some novels in the magazine L'ultima moda when it still published works in prose and poetry. Nell'azzurro, published by Trevisani in 1890, might be considered as her first work. Her family was unsupportive of her desire to write as it went against the social norms of the patriarchal system.[3] Possibly due to this, she published her first novel, Stella d’Oriente, under the pseudonym Ilia di Saint-Ismael.[4]  Still between prose and poetry are, among the first works, Paesaggi sardi, published by Speirani in 1896. In 1900, after having married Palmiro Madesani, functionary of the Ministry of War met in Cagliari in the October 1899, the writer moved to Rome and after the publishing of Anime oneste in 1895 and of Il vecchio della montagna in 1900, plus the collaboration with magazines La Sardegna, Piccola rivista and Nuova Antologia, her work began to gain critical interest. She had two sons and lived a quiet life occupied by her writing.[5] She was a very prolific writer publishing, on average, a novel a year.[6]  In 1903 she published Elias Portolu that confirmed her as a writer and started her work as a successful writer of novels and theatrical works: Cenere (1904), L'edera (1908), Sino al confine (1911), Colombi e sparvieri (1912), Canne al vento (1913) -her most well known book in Italy-, L'incendio nell'oliveto (1918), Il Dio dei venti (1922).  Cenere was the inspiration for a movie with the famous Italian actress Eleonora Duse.  She died in Rome at the age of 64 of breast cancer. La chiesa della solitudine (1936), Deledda's last novel, is a semi-autobiographical depiction of a young Italian woman coming to terms with her breast cancer. A completed manuscript of the novel Cosima (1937) was discovered after her death and published posthumously.[7]  Her work has been highly regarded by Luigi Capuana and Giovanni Verga plus some younger writers such as Enrico Thovez, Pietro Pancrazi, Renato Serra, and later until today by Sardinian writers such as Sergio Atzeni, Giulio Angioni, Salvatore Mannuzzu, starters of the so-called Sardinian Literary Spring.  Work[edit]      A portrait of Grazia Deledda    The life, customs, and traditions of the Sardinian people are prominent in her writing.[8] She relies heavily on geographical description and details and her work is most often concerned with transgressions.[9] Many of her characters are social outcasts that struggle in silence and isolation.[10] Deledda's whole work is based on strong facts of love, pain and death upon which rests the feeling of sin and of an inevitable fatality.  In her works we can recognize the influence of the verism of Giovanni Verga and, sometimes, also that of the decadentism by Gabriele D'Annunzio.  In Deledda's novels there is always a strong connection between places and people, feelings and environment. The environment depicted is mostly that one harsh of native Sardinia, but it is not depicted according to regional veristic schemes neither according to the otherworldly vision by D'Annunzio, but relived through the myth.  Deledda has not gained much recognition as a feminist writer potentially due to her themes of women’s pain and suffering as opposed to women’s autonomy.[11]  Main works[edit]      With her husband and son, Rome circa 1905     Fior di Sardegna (1892)  La via del male (1896)  Racconti sardi (1895)  Anime oneste (1895)  Dopo il divorzio (1902; English translation: After the divorce, 1905)  Elias Portolu (1903)  Cenere (1904; English translation: Ashes, 1908)  Nostalgie (1905)  L'edera (1908)  Canne al vento (1913)  Marianna Sirca (1915)  La madre (1920; English translation: The Woman and the Priest, 1922; English translation: The Mother, by D.
