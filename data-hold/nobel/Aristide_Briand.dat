He attended the Nantes Lycée, where, in 1877, he developed a close friendship with Jules Verne.[1] He studied law, and soon went into politics, associating himself with the most advanced movements, writing articles for the anarchist journal Le Peuple, and directing the Lanterne for some time. From this he passed to the Petite République, leaving it to found L'Humanité, in collaboration with Jean Jaurès.  Activism[edit]  At the same time he was prominent in the movement for the formation of trade unions, and at the congress of working men at Nantes in 1894 he secured the adoption of the labor union idea against the adherents of Jules Guesde. From that time, Briand was one of the leaders of the French Socialist Party. In 1902, after several unsuccessful attempts, he was elected deputy. He declared himself a strong partisan of the union of the Left in what was known as the Bloc, in order to check the reactionary Deputies of the Right.  From the beginning of his career in the Chamber of Deputies, Briand was occupied with the question of the separation of church and state. He was appointed reporter of the commission charged with the preparation of the 1905 law on separation, and his masterly report at once marked him out as one of the coming leaders. He succeeded in carrying his project through with but slight modifications, and without dividing the parties upon whose support he relied.  He was the principal author of the law of separation, but, not content with preparing it, he wished to apply it as well. The ministry of Maurice Rouvier was allowing disturbances during the taking of inventories of church property, a clause of the law for which Briand was not responsible. Consequently he accepted the portfolio of Public Instruction and Worship in the Sarrien ministry (1906). So far as the Chamber was concerned, his success was complete. But the acceptance of a position in a bourgeois ministry led to his exclusion from the Unified Socialist Party (March 1906). As opposed to Jaurès, he contended that the Socialists should co-operate actively with the Radicals in all matters of reform, and not stand aloof to await the complete fulfillment of their ideals.  He became a freemason in the lodge Le Trait d'Union in July 1887 while the lodge didn't record his name in spite of his repeated requests.[2] The lodge declared unworthy to him on 6 September 1889.[3] In 1895 he joined the lodge Les Chevaliers du Travail that was established in 1893.[2]  Prime Minister of France[edit]      Portrait of Aristide Briand    Briand succeeded Clemenceau as Prime Minister in 1909, serving until 1911, and served again for a few months in 1913. In October 1915, following French defeats in the First World War, Briand again became Prime Minister, and, for the first time, Foreign Minister, succeeding René Viviani and Théophile Delcassé respectively. His tenure was not particularly successful, and he resigned in March 1917 as a result of disagreements over the prospective Nivelle Offensive, to be succeeded by Alexandre Ribot.  1920s[edit]  Briand returned to power in 1921. He supervised the French role in the Washington Naval Conference of 1921–22. Three factors guided the French strategy and necessitated a Mediterranean focus: the French navy needed to carry a great many goods, the Mediterranean was the axis of chief interest, and a supply of oil was essential. The primary goal was to defend French North Africa, and Briand made practical choices, for naval policy was a reflection of overall foreign policy. The Conference agreed on the American proposal that capital ships be limited to a ratio of 5 to 5 to 3 for the United States, Britain, and Japan, with Italy and France allocated 1.7 each. France's participation reflected its need to deal with its diminishing power and reduced human, material, and financial resources.[4]  Briand's efforts to come to an agreement over reparations with the Germans failed in the wake of German intransigence, and he was succeeded by the more bellicose Raymond Poincaré. In the wake of the Ruhr Crisis, however, Briand's more conciliatory style became more acceptable, and he returned to the Quai d'Orsay in 1925. He would remain foreign minister until his death in 1932. During this time, he was a member of 14 cabinets, three of which he headed himself.  Briand negotiated the Briand-Ceretti Agreement with the Vatican, giving the French government a role in the appointment of Catholic bishops.  Kellogg–Briand Pact[edit]      Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann    Aristide Briand received the 1926 Nobel Peace Prize together with Gustav Stresemann of Germany for the Locarno Treaties (Austen Chamberlain of the United Kingdom had received a share of the Peace Prize a year earlier for the same agreement).  A 1927 proposal by Briand and United States Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg for a universal pact outlawing war led the following year to the Pact of Paris, aka the Kellogg–Briand Pact.  The cordial relations between Briand and Stresemann, the leading statesmen of their respective countries, were cut short by the unexpected death of Stresemann in 1929 and of Briand in 1932.  Briand Plan for European union[edit]  As foreign minister Briand formulated an original proposal for a new economic union of Europe.[5] Described as Briand's Locarno diplomacy and as an aspect of Franco-German rapprochement, it was his answer to Germany's quick economic recovery and future political power. Briand made his proposals in a speech in favor of a European Union in the League of Nations on 5 September 1929, and in 1930, in his Memorandum on the Organization of a Regime of European Federal Union for the Government of France.[6] The idea was to provide a framework to contain France's former enemy while preserving as much of the 1919 Versailles settlement as possible. The Briand plan entailed the economic collaboration of the great industrial areas of Europe and the provision of political security to Eastern Europe against Soviet threats. The basis was economic cooperation, but his fundamental concept was political, for it was political power that would determine economic choices. The plan, under the Memorandum on the Organization of a System of European Federal Union, was in the end presented as a French initiative to the League of Nations. With the death of his principal supporter, German foreign minister Gustav Stresemann, and the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, Briand's plan was never adopted but it suggested an economic framework for developments after World War II that eventually resulted in the European Union.[7]  Governments[edit]  Briand's first Government, 24 July 1909 – 3 November 1910[edit]   Aristide Briand – President of the Council and Minister of the Interior and Worship  Stéphen Pichon – Minister of Foreign Affairs  Jean Brun – Minister of War  Georges Cochery – Minister of Finance  René Viviani – Minister of Labour and Social Security Provisions  Louis Barthou – Minister of Justice  Auguste Boué de Lapeyrère – Minister of Marine  Gaston Doumergue – Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts  Joseph Ruau – Minister of Agriculture  Georges Trouillot – Minister of Colonies  Alexandre Millerand – Minister of Public Works, Posts, and Telegraphs  Jean Dupuy – Minister of Commerce and Industry   Briand's second Government, 3 November 1910 – 2 March 1911[edit]   Aristide Briand – President of the Council and Minister of the Interior and Worship  Stéphen Pichon – Minister of Foreign Affairs  Jean Brun – Minister of War  Louis Lucien Klotz – Minister of Finance  Louis Lafferre – Minister of Labour and Social Security Provisions  Théodore Girard – Minister of Justice  Auguste Boué de Lapeyrère – Minister of Marine  Maurice Faure – Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts  Maurice Raynaud – Minister of Agriculture  Jean Morel – Minister of Colonies  Louis Puech – Minister of Public Works, Posts, and Telegraphs  Jean Dupuy – Minister of Commerce and Industry   Changes   23 February 1911 – Briand succeeds Brun as interim Minister of War.
