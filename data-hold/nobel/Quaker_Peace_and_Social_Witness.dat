(April 2009) Quaker Peace &amp; Social Witness (QPSW), previously known as the Friends Service Council, and then as Quaker Peace and Service, is one of the central committees of Britain Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends - the national organisation of Quakers in Britain. It works to promote British Quakers' testimonies of equality, justice, peace, simplicity and truth. It works alongside both small local and large international pressure groups.  In 1947, the then Friends Service Council shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the American counterpart American Friends Service Committee.

South Asia: QPSW works to strengthen the nonviolence movement in the Indian sub-continent by helping to link peace and social change organisations.  QPSW and AFSC were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1947.  History[edit]  The roots of QPSW are in the missionary work done under the name of Friends Foreign Mission Association (1868–1927). With the decline of the missions, the Mission Association merged with the Council for International Service (1919–1927) to form the Friends Service Council (1927–1978). Which was renamed Quaker Peace and Service (1979–2000), known as Quaker Peace &amp; Social Witness since 2001.
