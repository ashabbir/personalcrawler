Video Games for Grown-Ups  With gamer demographics changing fast, “deep games” offer cerebral, creative—and often upbeat—content.  As the industry scrambles to keep up with evolving tastes and technology, this new sensibility could herald a big shift in the way the developers approach their product. A perfect storm of distribution channels, game literacy, and appetite for content has led to an explosion of aesthetic games that deal with quieter emotions, says Katherine Isbister, a professor in NYU's gaming program. There's now a robust, diverse market for games that may not be blockbusters, but can be profitable because they have much lower production costs. Read the article here.
