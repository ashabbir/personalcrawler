For vital computer networks and electronic infrastructures, cybersecurity experts stand as the last and most effective line of defense against such attacks.  At the School of Engineering, our MS in Cybersecurity program curriculum is rooted in the belief that theory and research must translate into real-world solutions. To this end, we operate the National Science Foundation-funded Information Systems and Internet Security (ISIS) laboratory. We’ve also built a remotely accessible and virtual laboratory called VITAL, which serves as a shared, central facility for a consortium of universities in New York City.  The School of Engineering has a distinguished history of research and education in the field of cybersecurity, and our classes are taught by internationally known experts. We’ve been designated an NSA Center of Excellence in Information Assurance, a Center of Excellence in Research, and a Center of Excellence in Cyber Operations. Our curriculum meets the National Training Standards set by the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS).  The cybersecurity field is expected to generate many new jobs over the next decade as industry and government continue to emphasize safe data and information systems. As a graduate of the program, you’ll be ready for a career as a developer of security products, security application programmer, security analyst, and penetration tester. You can also pursue work as a security researcher, vulnerability analyst, or security architect, or continue your studies toward a doctorate.  Admission Requirements  You need a superior undergraduate record from an accredited institution in order to be considered for entrance into the program. Preferably, you should have an undergraduate degree in computer science, mathematics, science, or engineering. However, applicants with degrees in other fields are considered individually for admission. You must also satisfy the following:   Knowledge of mathematics through calculus  At least 1 year of university-level science  A working knowledge of a high-level, general-purpose programming language (preferably C++) and of data structures  Demonstrated ability to communicate in written and spoken English. Foreign students and others for whom English is a second language may be required to undertake preparatory work to improve their language skills before admission into the graduate program.  Statement of Purpose: You should submit a special purpose statement with your application that states your experience in cybersecurity and your motivation for applying to the program.  A basic understanding of computer fundamentals such as computer organization and operation, data structures, and computer architecture.  GRE scores   Students who have superior academic credentials but lack sufficient background will be evaluated on a case by case basis. In some cases a student may be admitted with a conditional status pending the satisfactory completion of preparatory bridge courses with a B or better average.  Admission with advanced standing is accepted in accordance with the School of Engineering regulations published in the catalog. A maximum of 9 credits may be applied to the MS degree from previous graduate work at an acceptable institution.  Transfer of Courses  Students with a prior MS or an advanced degree from another institution may be allowed to transfer at most 2 courses taken less than 3 years ago. The Cybersecurity MS Program Committee will determine the course equivalence of the transferred coursework. For each course to be transferred, you must provide a complete description, along with the lecture and assignment materials.  Transfers from Other the School of Engineering Programs  Qualified MS students registered in other the School of Engineering master's programs (e.g., the Computer Science master's program), who can demonstrate adequate skills in the area of cybersecurity, may be permitted to transfer to the MS in Cybersecurity program per the admissions requirements outlined on this page.  Transfers to the PhD Program in Computer Science  Qualified Cybersecurity MS students can transfer to the PhD program in Computer Science. The MS Program Committee must first recommend the applicant to the PhD Admissions Committee.   This program is also offered online.
