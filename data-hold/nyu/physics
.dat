Applied Physics is the branch of physics where the implications and uses of fundamental physics knowledge are explored and exploited.  The Applied Physics Department is committed to providing high-quality introductory, intermediate, and advanced-level physics courses to the Institute’s engineering and science departments. Through our undergraduate major we train new generations of physicists capable of applying the tools of physics to contemporary problems for the benefit of all. And through close collaborations with other departments, we enable engineering research and education with physics knowledge and techniques, and serve as a catalyst for research in other scientific and engineering fields.
