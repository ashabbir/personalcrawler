It is a career field in high demand and it was recently ranked as the fifth most valuable college major (Forbes, May 2012). At the School of Engineering our program has an urban environmental systems emphasis and it is unique in concentrating on many challenges that New York City and major cities of the world face.  The MS in Environmental Engineering prepares graduates to plan, functionally design, control, operate and manage municipal and industrial pollution-prevention systems. Students are exposed to a learning atmosphere that provides a mix of theory and practical problem solving approaches. The flexible course options and student research projects offer a variety of opportunities. Areas of research and scholarly activities supported by some of the best faculty in NYC include environmental systems management, monitoring, sensing, and visualization, water security, flood risk management, conflict resolution, river water quality modeling, ground water modeling, solid and hazardous waste management, contamination remediation, climate change studies, and development of decision support systems and GIS based applications.
