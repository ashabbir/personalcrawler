The goal of CDUHR is to enhance interdisciplinary research on HIV/AIDS and related infectious diseases among drug users and other vulnerable populations. The center provides a supportive research infrastructure for researchers who are engaged in HIV/AIDS-related research projects at four institutions: New York University, the National Development and Research Institutes, Inc., Beth Israel Medical Center, and the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. CDUHR’s goal is the development of new knowledge, theory and research methods by creating opportunities for collaboration among investigators within and across multiple institutions, and providing a wide range of support and services to the affiliated investigators.  CDUHR provides assistance with research grant proposal submissions at various stages of development including: the development of significant and innovative research questions; reviews of brief concept papers that describe initial research plans; the integration of theory, methods and data analysis; comparative effectiveness research, and administrative support. The center also provides consultation during the implementation of research projects, as well as access to centralized resources to foster efficiency in project functioning and enhance dissemination of project findings. CDUHR offers a monthly seminar series with prominent researchers that focuses on topics related to the center’s theme. Additional meetings and presentations are held throughout the year to update researchers on critical topics in the field, develop new areas of interest and skills, and provide opportunities to exchange ideas that advance the science of the HIV and drug use epidemic and develop interdisciplinary collaborations.
