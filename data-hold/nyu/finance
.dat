The MS in Financial Engineering at the School of Engineering gives students solid, specialized skills to bridge the gap between theory and practice in finance and financial engineering.  The School of Engineering Financial Engineering degree was initiated with the generous support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was the second program of its kind, anywhere. We were the first curriculum to be certified by the International Association of Financial Engineers. We offer a graduate program either on a full-time or part-time basis and seek collaboration with industry on research projects that allow students to apply their existing knowledge and acquire new insights into financial engineering and its many derivative professions. Currently, the MS-FE program at the School of Engineering is the largest program of its kind in the world with 350 graduate student candidates from all across the globe. Our faculty is comprised of adjunct, industry, and research professors, all with extensive practical expertise, who produce world-class research while teaching both introductory and advanced courses in a small class setting.
