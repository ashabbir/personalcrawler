Besides our core curriculum in the fundamentals of computer science, you have a wealth of electives to choose from. You can focus on such topics as computer and network security, distributed systems and networking, computer graphics, and web search technology, along with subjects outside the department.  Job opportunities in computer science are challenging and diverse, and we expect to see steady demand for highly qualified graduates at all levels. As a graduate, you can explore a number of possible occupations, including applications programmer, database manager, systems administrator, or IT analyst.  With our MS program in Computer Science, you wil have maximum curriculum flexibility, allowing you to adapt your program to your ambitions and goals as well as to your educational and professional backgrounds. Not only will you gain a solid grounding in the fundamentals of computer science, but professional-level courses, and an oppportunity to specialize in selected technology areas of your choice.  Admission Requirements  Admission to this program requires you to have an undergraduate degree in computer science, mathematics, science, or engineering, with a superior undergraduate record from an accredited institution. Applicants with degrees in other fields are considered individually for admission. Generally, entering students are expected to know mathematics through calculus.  Please note: due to the success of the MS - Computer Science program in Fall 2014, the program is no longer accepting applications for the Spring 2015 semester. Applications for the Fall 2015 semester are currently being accepted.  Additional Entrance Requirements   At least 1 year of university-level science.  A working knowledge of a high-level, general-purpose programming language (preferably C++).  A basic understanding of computer fundamentals such as computer organization and operation, data structures, and computer architecture.  Demonstrated ability to communicate in written and spoken English is required for regular status. Foreign students and others for whom English is a second language may be required to undertake preparatory work to improve their language skills.   Students entering with a bachelor’s in computer science or with a bachelor’s in a technical area and a strong minor in computer science should be able to satisfy entrance requirements for the master’s degree program.  Students who have superior academic credentials but who lack sufficient background are admitted with conditional status, pending satisfactory completion of several individually specified preparatory courses. In some cases, such students are interviewed to determine the preparatory courses they need to complete. Successful completion of the preparatory courses with a B or better average grade is a necessary condition for transfer to regular status.  Admission with advanced standing is accepted in accordance with the School of Engineering regulations. A maximum of 9 credits may be applied to the MS degree from previous graduate work at an acceptable institution.                            Program Director       Edward K.
