The program provides broad yet          rigorous training in areas of mathematics and computer science          related to scientific computing. It aims to prepare people          with the right talents and background for a technical career          doing practical computing.           The program accommodates both full-time and part-time          students, with most courses meeting in the evening. The          program is self-contained and terminal, providing a complete          set of skills in a field where the need is greater than the          supply. The masters program focuses on computational science,          which includes modeling and numerical simulation as used in          engineering design, development, and optimization.                    During the academic years of 2012 and 2013 a concentration in          data sciences existed within the scientific computing program;          this concentration has been discontinued as of 2014. Incoming          students interested in data sciences should consider the          recently-created Masters            of Science in Data Science within the NYU Center for Data            Science.                   Starting Fall of 2014 the modified the program requirements          and guidelines listed below will apply to all incoming          students. The new list of required/approved courses includes          the previous list but gives additional flexibility for          students to tailor the list of courses to their background and          interests. Students presently enrolled in the Modeling and          Simulation track can choose to complete the program either          under the new or the old requirements. Students enrolled in          the Data Science concentration should consult the expanded          course options and modified requirements below since this          increases flexibility while maintaining consistency with the          previous requirements. These students should contact Professor          Esteban Tabak for help          in deciding on classes to take.                            Scientific Computing:            Overview                     Scientific computing is an indispensable part of almost all          scientific investigation and technological development at          universities, government laboratories, and within the private          sector. Typically a scientific computing team consists of          several people trained in some branch of mathematics, science,          statistics, or engineering. What is often lacking is expertise          in modern computing tools such as visualization, modern          programming paradigms, and high performance computing. The          master's program in scientific computing aims to satisfy these          needs, without omitting basic training in numerical analysis          and computer science. Many graduates of this program work at          technologically advanced institutions, especially in research          and development, where their skills and experience complement          those without interdisciplinary degrees. The program is also          open to students who will go on to pursue doctoral studies in          computer science, mathematics, or statistics.           The master's program in scientific computing focuses on the          mathematics and computer science related to advanced computer          modeling and simulation. The program is similar in structure          to terminal master's programs in engineering, combining          classroom training with practical experience. The coursework          ranges from foundational mathematics and fundamental          algorithms to such practical topics as data visualization and          software tools. Electives encourage the exploration of          specific application areas such as mathematical and          statistical finance, applications of machine learning, fluid          mechanics, finite element methods, and biomedical modeling.          The program culminates in a master's project, which serves to          integrate the classroom material.                    Admission Requirements          The program requires least three semesters of Calculus          (including multivariate calculus), as well as linear algebra.          Experience with programming in a high-level language (e.g.,          Java, C, C++, Fortran. Python) as well as data structures,          equivalent to a first-year sequence in computer science,Â           is also required. It is highly desirable that applicants have          undergraduate major or significant experience in mathematics,          a quantitative science or engineering, or economics.          The deadline for application to the program is March 15th for          the fall semester. The program admits students both on a          full-time and on a part-time basis. The application process          takes place online via the Graduate School of Arts and          Sciences; please visit the Graduate            School Admissions site.

Students with exceptional backgrounds may petition the program        director for permission to substitute other appropriate courses        for core courses. Advanced students may be permitted to do a        masters thesis as an alternative to the master's capstone        project.                   Core Courses          The following are the two required core courses          in mathematics:                              MATH-GA                2010 Numerical Methods I (fall semester)            MATH-GA                2020 Numerical Methods II (spring semester)                  Students must also complete at least two of the following core        courses in mathematics:                    MATH-GA                2701 Methods of Applied Mathematics (fall            semester)            MATH-GA-2490 Partial Differential Equations I (fall)            MATH-GA                2702 Fluid Dynamics (fall semester)            MATH-GA-2962 Mathematical Statistics (if offered)                       MATH-GA-2704 Applied Stochastic Analysis (spring semester)            DS-GA-1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods                  Advanced students may also choose the two additional core        courses from the following advanced topics courses in applied        math and numerical analysis, typically offered bi-anually:                     MATH-GA Advanced Topics: Optimization                       MATH-GA Advanced Topics: Optimization and Data Analysis            MATH-GA Advanced Topics: Monte Carlo            MATH-GA Advanced Topics: Computational Fluid Dynamics            MATH-GA Advanced Topics: Finite Element Methods                              The following are the two required core courses          in computer science:                      CSCI-GA                1170 Fundamental Algorithms (fall, spring and            summer terms)            CSCI-GA                2110 Programming Languages (fall, spring, and            summer terms)                  Students must also complete at least two of the following core        courses in computer science:                     CSCI-GA                3033 Open Source Tools (fall term)            CSCI-GA                2270 Computer Graphics (spring term)            CSCI-GA                2565 Machine Learning (fall term)            CSCI-GA.2566 Foundations of Machine Learning            DS-GA-1001 Introduction to Data Science (fall)                       DS-GA-1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics            (spring)            DS-GA-1004: Big Data (spring)                  Advanced students may also choose the two additional core        courses from advanced topics courses in computer science of        relevance to Scientific Computing, such as:                     CSCI-GA Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)            CSCI-GA Advanced Topics: High-Performance Computing                  The departments of mathematics and computer science publish        annual brochures describing all courses offered each year.        Students should consult these lists of course offerings to        determine the availability of desired courses.         Concentration in Data          Science         This section is meant only for students presently enrolled in        the Data Science concentration; this concentration is no longer        offered. To graduate, students enrolled in the old concentration        are required to take the following core courses        in mathematics for the concentration in data science:                          Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  One of                    MATH-GA                2962 Mathematical Statistics (spring semester),            DS-GA-1001 Introduction to Data Science (fall), or                       DS-GA-1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods                             and either                       MATH-GA                2043 Scientific Computing (fall and spring            semesters)                             or both                       MATH-GA                2010 Numerical Methods I (fall semester) and                       MATH-GA                2020 Numerical Methods II (spring semester)                   The following are the three required core courses          in computer science for the concentration in data science:                      CSCI-GA                1170 Fundamental Algorithms (fall, spring and            summer terms)            CSCI-GA                3033 Open Source Tools (fall term)                  and one of                    CSCI-GA                2565 Machine Learning (fall term), or            DS-GA-1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics            (spring)                  Students in the concentration in data science must complete 33        points points of course credit (11 courses), including core and        elective courses. They must also obtain 3 points from a master's        capstone project.                  The Capstone Project          The master's program culminates in a capstone project. The          capstone project course is usually taken during the final year          of study. During the project, students go through the entire          process of solving a real-world problem, from collecting and          processing data to designing and fully implementing a          solution. The problems and data sets come from settings          identical to those encountered in industry, academia, or          government.                   The following is a list of courses approved to meet the          capstone requirement:                       MATH-GA.2011/CSCI-GA.2945            Advanced topics: Data Science            CSCI-GA Advanced Topics: High-Performance Computing            DS-GA-1006 Capstone Project in Data Science            CSCI-GAÂ  Advanced Computer GraphicsÂ             CSCI-GAÂ  Multicore Processors: Architecture            &amp;ProgrammingÂ             CSCI-GAÂ  Software Engineering                    Advanced students can obtain permission from the director of          the program to do an individual capstone project under the          supervision of a faculty member.                            Computing Facilities          The Courant Institute makes available for graduate training          and coursework a network of workstations maintained by systems          administrators. All graduate students have computer accounts          for the duration of their studies. NYU also runs a          high-performance computing center with both shared-memory and          distributed-memory computers.

Academic Standards          To register for courses, students must maintain good academic          standing, fulfilling the following requirements:                      Students must maintain an average of B or better over            their first twelve credits. Students who fail to achieve            this cannot continue in the master's program.            Students cannot obtain a master's degree unless they have            maintained an overall average of B or better.
