The PhD program requires a minimum of three academic years of full-time graduate-level study (a minimum of 12 credits per semester) after the master’s degree or their equivalent in part-time study.  All applicants for admission to PhD study in the New York University College of Nursing (NYUCN) must submit a completed admission application, official transcripts documenting higher education, and official scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) general test. A satisfactory score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or IELTS is mandatory for all applicants whose native language is not English and who did not receive a bachelor’s degree at an English-speaking college or university. All applicants must have a minimum of 3.0 GPA from an accredited nursing program.  Applicants should arrange to take the GRE through the Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ 08541; www.ets.org. Scores, to be official, must be reported through the Educational Testing Service to the Office of Graduate Admissions, New York University, College of Nursing, 726 Broadway, 10th floor, New York, NY 10003. The score report code number for NYUCN is 1617.   Back to top    Application Information   Applications for PhD study are considered for the fall semester only; January 15th is the deadline for submission of all materials. Applications will be accepted after the deadline on a rolling basis. All deadlines listed are ‘in office’ deadlines, not postmark deadlines. It is always to the candidate’s best advantage to apply early especially when applying for financial aid. Those who meet the January 15th deadline will have priority regarding admissions and scholarships. Should any of the dates listed fall on a weekend, the deadline will be the next working day.  The NYUCN PhD program has a PhD admissions committee that will further evaluate the applicant’s application based on the following:   The applicant’s grade point average from previous degree programs.  The applicant’s verbal and quantitative scores on the GRE. All GRE scores must be official as determined by the Office of Graduate Admissions.   Personal statement of 3 to 5 pages.  Personal interview, where appropriate.  The applicant’s work and academic background: demonstration of professional performance/contribution to nursing, e.g., a list of your research, writing/publications; professional organizations or student groups in which you are involved or to which you have contributed; a list of honors from professional societies.
