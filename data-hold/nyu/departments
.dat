For example, our Chemical and Biological Engineering department had its genesis during the first half of our history, as the Department of Chemical Engineering. As the need for bio-based chemistry grew, we met that demand with expanded curricula and dedicated researchers and faculty.  And because we’re a smaller institution, our departments are nimble, able to do the interdisciplinary work that today’s advances require.
