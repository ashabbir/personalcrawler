Partridge, PhD  Professor, Basic Science &amp; Craniofacial Biology  Associate Chair: Eric Baker, M.Phil Adjunct Associate Professor, Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology  Overview   The Department of Basic Science is one of the largest departments in the College, established by the fusion of six separate departments under one chair. NYUCD is one of a handful of private dental schools with its own basic science faculty. The faculty participates in all aspects of the college life: education, scholarly activity, research, and service. In addition, they teach in all programs of the College: graduate, postgraduate, and allied health. Members of the department are nationally and internationally renowned scientists, educators, and academic leaders.       RESEARCH                                                                                                                              Biological Anthropology Research                                                                                            Research includes the study of:   primate bone and dental microstructural correlates of organismal life history, biological timing, and metabolism;  comparative bone microanatomy of extant primates for interpreting locomotor function and phylogeny in fossil species;  primate behavioral ecology and cognition; and   craniofacial development and function in humans and extinct fossil relatives.

Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)  The Center was established to enhance and coordinate the efforts of NYU clinicians, scientists and clinician scientists who work in different aspects of craniofacial and musculoskeletal biology with the ultimate goal to develop novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of craniofacial disorders and musculoskeletal diseases. The mission of the Center is to raise the tempo of research into diseases which affect craniofacial development and the skeleton leading to new knowledge, resulting in improving and new treatments for these diseases.
