They let us chat via web cams, send e-mails from cell phones, and withdraw cash from ATMs. But computer-based devices and information networks aren’t the only products computer engineers develop; they reconstruct genomes, design robots, and develop software to make businesses more efficient. That’s just the kind of invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship that the School of Engineering encourages.  Our BS program in Computer Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET (www.abet.org). The program has a comprehensive analysis and design curriculum that provides an outstanding, cutting-edge education in computer systems with emphasis on hardware and software, The program incorporates the latest market and technology trends and combines the traditional disciplines of electronics, communications, control and computer programming with newer courses, such as Cyber Security, Nanoscale Circuit Design, Parallel Computers, Image Processing, Biomedical Instrumentation, Web Search Engines, Wireless Networks, Peer-to-Peer Networks, SoC (System-on-a-Chip), VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) and Game Development.  Recognizing the need for well-rounded engineers, we also emphasize strong communication and interpersonal skills. Our students develop these skills not only through required courses in the humanities and social sciences but also during team projects in design classes. Sponsored research and affiliate programs at our Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications (CATT), and Information Systems and Internet Security (ISIS) Lab also put you in constant contact with alumni and instructors whose experience in the industry you can draw upon.  Graduates of our program have gone on to design microchips and computer graphics, monitor and control industrial plants, and develop embedded hardware/software systems. They also occupy positions in manufacturing, research, financial services, health, and government, or create their own companies.  With departmental permission, you may earn a single bachelor’s degree in electrical and computer engineering. This degree requires a minimum of 142 credits rather than the typical 128 required for individual bachelor’s degrees.  Program Educational Objectives  The broad objectives of the Electrical Engineering Program are:    Graduates are expected to be engaged and advancing in their professional careers in a profession that utilizes their NYU Polytechnic degree, in Computer Engineering or other career path, that include industry, academia, and governmental or non-governmental organizations.  Graduates are expected to be seeking continuous professional development and life-long learning through graduate school studies, continuing education credits and/or professional registration.   Student Outcomes  In order to prepare our students to meet these objectives after graduation the ECE department has adopted the ABET a-k criteria as the appropriate student outcomes that our curriculum is designed to foster in our students:  (a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering  (b) an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data  (c) an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability  (d) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams  (e) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems  (f) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility  (g) an ability to communicate effectively  (h) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context  (i) a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning  (j) a knowledge of contemporary issues  (k) an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice    Minor in Computer Engineering  You may obtain a minor in computer engineering by taking the following courses with a GPA of 2.0 or better.  EE 2013 Fundamentals of Electric Circuits I, Credits: 3.00 EE 2024 Fundamentals of Electric Circuits II, Credits: 4.00 CS 2204 Digital Logic and State Machine Design, Credits: 4.00 EE 4144 Introduction to Embedded Systems Design, Credits: 4.00  For students not earning the BS degree in computer science, EE 4144 may be replaced by CS 2214 Computer Architecture. You must take a minimum of 8 credits at the School of Engineering. Students for whom CS1133/CS1114 is not required for major should note that CS 1133/CS 1114 is a prerequisite for CS 2204. The minor in computer engineering is not open to students earning the BS degree in electrical engineering.
