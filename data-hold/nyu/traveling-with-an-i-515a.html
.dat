Got lucky and an officer let you into the country with something called an I-515A? If you receive an I-515A upon entry but will leave the United States within the 30-day period of I-515A admission, you need to fax the following (listed below) to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) at 703-603-3597 Attn: I-515A Processing Team.      If these documents are not received by the SEVP I-515A Unit before you travel, it could cause you to appear not to have complied with the I-515A requirements, and could result in future issues when trying to leave or re-enter. Please be sure to keep careful records and copies of everything you send or fax to SEVP.            FAX to SEVP                    Copy of your signed I-20 or DS-2019                   Copy of the Form I-515A                Copy of I-94 Record                Copy of Airline Ticket or Itinerary  A copy of airline ticket or other confirmation of departure itinerary within the 30 day window.
