Biomaterials play a fundamental role in most dental diagnostic and restorative procedures. The department���s programs are enhanced by a long history of funded research and an extensively equipped research suite for biomaterials development and characterization, much of it centered around new materials, biological models, calcium phosphate chemistry, and investigations on hard tissue architecture and regeneration.                           meet our faculty Read More                           MS Program in Biomaterials Read More                           shared scientific core resources Read More             PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM  The department���s educational and research role is enhanced by            the M.S. Degree Program in Biomaterials and Biomimetics, offered in            collaboration with the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science. This            provides the opportunity for dental graduate and postgraduate students            to work on a broad range of research projects in collaboration with            graduate students with materials and engineering backgrounds. The student            educational experience is also strengthened by interaction with visiting            scholars from other research institutions from around the world.                                                                                                                              First and Second Years                                                                                             The Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics contributes to the undergraduate          dental educational program with lectures and laboratory exercises that          are integrated into freshman and sophomore General Dentistry Simulation          Programs to provide timely presentation of biomaterials course content.                                                                                                                                                                                   Third and Fourth Years                                                                                             These first two years programs are then enhanced by presentations integrated            into the junior-year program covering the latest research findings and            the translation of these into new clinical techniques and restorative            and reconstructive philosophies. This requires close coordination with            the other clinical departments of the Division of Reconstructive and            Comprehensive Care and with the Division of Diagnostics, Infectious            Disease, and Health Promotion.                                                       RESEARCH  These projects involve high school students, dental students, postgraduate dentists, MS students, faculty, and visiting scholars and researchers.                                                                                                                                Projects                                                                                              Selective              removal of carious dentin with polymer burs   Microtensile              bond strength of adhesives to enamel, dentin, and ceramics   Fatigue              and damage in dental ceramic crown structures   Enhance              deposition of calcium phosphates on metal surfaces by selective surface              treatments   Electrochemical              deposition of adherent coatings consisting of apatites, substituted              apatites, or related calcium phosphates on Ti and Ti alloy   Modification              of surface composition and properties of Ti and Ti alloy substrates   Biomimetic              methods of depositing coatings on implants   Role of              defined surface topographical features on implant tissue interactions   Role of              implant architecture at micro-, meso-, and macrolevels on induction              of bone   Role of              implant features on control of transcutaneous tissues for neurological              leads   Cell/materials              interaction with bone graft materials using osteoblast-like, odontoblast-like,              or periodontal ligament cells    Biomimetic              growth of calcium phosphates on enamel or dentin surfaces   Calcium              phosphate-based biomaterials (ceramics, cements, composites) and scaffolds              for engineered tissue response   Surface              preparation methods and               treatments on directed recalcification of enamel   Fatigue              of implant abutment fixtures   Hertzian              contact response of dental hard tissues                                                                                Academic Programs     DDS Program     Dental Hygiene Programs     Advanced Education Programs     Master's Degree Programs     Certificate Program in Clinical Research     Programs for International Dentists                      Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                    Research     Research at NYUCD     Bluestone Center for Clinical Research     HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)     Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)     NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                    Patient Care     Become a Patient at NYUCD     Emergency Services / Urgent Care     General Dentistry     Pediatric Dentistry     Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery     Orthodontics     Implant Dentistry     Endodontics     Periodontics     Prosthodontics     Special Needs Program     Patient Advocate     Linhart CDE Program     NYU Dental Faculty Practices     NYU Oral Cancer Center     NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                    Quick Links     About Us     Admissions Information     Academy of Distinguished Educators     Interprofessional Education     Current Students     Intranet     Departments/Faculty     Global Reach     News, Publications and Facts     Employment     Contact Us     Directions                                                Connect        NYU College of Dentistry 345 E. 24th Street (corner of First Avenue) New York, NY, 10010      (212) 998-9800                                  NYUCD Facebook Page                NYUCD Twitter Page                NYUCD YouTube Page                NYUCD LinkedIn Page                                          MAKE A GIFT                                                         Copyright © New York University College of Dentistry  Feedback
