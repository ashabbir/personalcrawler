They share tested perspectives and trade new ideas about what could alleviate rush hour congestion or how to increase ridership. Join them and our distinguished faculty as you achieve greater understanding of the issues facing transportation management in the near- and long-term future.  Located in a city with one of the world’s most complex transit systems, our campus is a gateway to an ideal laboratory for those wishing to study the discipline. Together our students and faculty focus on the fundamentals of management and the economics at play for public and private sector agencies. We also look at how transportation projects can be optimized and how local, state, and national policies affect residents and businesses.  Armed with this knowledge, graduates of the program discover the confidence needed to move ahead in the fields of transportation and facility management.  Admission Requirements  To be eligible for admission to the School of Engineering's MS in Transportation Management program, you must hold at least a baccalaureate degree from an acceptable institution. You must also show evidence of quantitative analytic ability, generally including a minimum of 2 years of college mathematics. A college-level course in statistics is desirable.  If admitted, students lacking such skills must take remedial courses in addition to degree requirements to strengthen their analytic competency.  All foreign students admitted to transportation programs must take an examination in English before registration. Based upon an evaluation of the examination, they may be required to take up to 2 additional courses in English as a Second Language (ESL) for which no graduate credit is given.
