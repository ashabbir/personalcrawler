This modeling creates exciting openings for innovative, custom-designed instruments in the marketplace that allow you to turn financial theory into applied practice.  At the School of Engineering, we train our students to do exactly that. Our MS in Financial Engineering program furnishes you with foundational knowledge in financial concepts. This knowledge then becomes a springboard to specialized fields where you can apply concepts to everything from derivatives and securitization to algorithmic trading and data mining. You can follow 4 different tracks as you earn your degree: Financial Markets and Corporate Finance, Computational Finance, Technology and Algorithmic Finance, and Risk Finance.  The department has a Research Institute that emphasizes specialized research areas and provides research opportunitie, such as personal finance and investments, financial regulation, as well as research that emphasizes trading platforms and software development and the management of financial technology.  Careers and employment opportunities include trading, investments, financial risk management, pricing, as well as corporate financial positions in a broad array of firms, such as financial services, insurance, industrial, and business.  Admission Requirements  Please note: due to the success of the MS - Financial Engineering program in Fall 2014, the program is no longer accepting applications for the Spring 2015 semester. Applications for the Fall 2015 semester are currently being accepted.  To be admitted into the master’s in Financial Engineering program, you must have a bachelor’s degree and superior mathematical talent. Students with degrees in other fields may be admitted at the discretion of departmental advisers. Before beginning graduate studies, conditionally approved students must demonstrate proficiency in basic statistics, probability and mathematics. The Department makes available refresher courses for this purpose and to serve the population of students who have been out of academia prior to matriculating into this program. Prerequisites: GRE exam scores, Calculus (MA 1124 or equivalent) Probability and Statistics (MA 2212 and MA 2222 or equivalent), and Linear Algebra (MA 2012 or equivalent).
