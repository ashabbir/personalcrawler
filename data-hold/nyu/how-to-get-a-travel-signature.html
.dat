For students on post-completion Optional Practical Training, the travel signature is only valid for six months.                              In New York City  Bring these documents to OGS walk-in advising hours and ask for a travel signature.                                Your passport                             Your I-20 or DS-2019                             A printout of your I-94 record                                             Outside New York City or the U.S.  Did you depart from the U.S. without getting your I-20 or DS-2019 signed? Are you outside of New York City and need a travel signature? Did you lose or forget to bring your I-20 or DS-2019 with you?   Depending on your return date to the U.S., there are different steps for securing a travel signature.                                                                                                                                 Returning within one week                                                                                            STEP 1   Check your I-20 or DS-2019 if you have it with you  The travel signature on page 3 of your most recent I-20 or on the right lower side of your DS-2019 is valid for 12 months. You may still have a valid signature. If you do not, continue to step 2.     STEP 2  Request a Form I-515A at the U.S. port of entry   If you must re-enter the U.S. in less than a week, respectfully request that the officer at the U.S. port of entry allow you to enter with Form I-515A. This gives you a thirty-day admission as an F-1 or J-1 student, and requires you to report to the OGS within that time frame to secure the required travel signature.  To qualify for the Form I-515A, you must have a valid passport, valid F-1 or J-1 visa, and your I-20 or DS-2019 (the officer may allow you to enter without your I-20 or DS-2019 at his/her discretion).                                                                                                                                                                        Returning more than a week into the future                                                                                            STEP 1  Check your I-20 or DS-2019 if you have it with you  The travel signature on page 3 of your most recent I-20 or on the right lower side of your DS-2019 is valid for 12 months. You may still have a valid signature. If you do not, continue to step 2.     STEP 2  Contact ogs@nyu.edu and request a travel I-20 or DS-2019  Be sure to attach a completed FERPA request form, a scan of your passport photo page, a receipt that you have paid the express mail fee, and a scan of your EAD card if you are currently on post-completion OPT. The OGS will then generate a new I-20 or DS-2019 document and return it to you via UPS express mail. We take up to 2 weeks to get the new I-20 or DS-2019 to you.                                                                    See more:   Documents to Carry  How to Get a New Visa  Traveling to Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean  Post Completion Travel  Traveling with an I-515A                                             NYU Footer                       Search              Directory              Campus Map              Events              Contact Us              Site Map              Copyright and Fair Use              Feedback                   Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
