That trend, which is only expected to accelerate in coming years, strains our transportation systems, with growing congestion leading to longer travel times, more air pollution, and higher fuel consumption.  Thankfully, professionals trained in transportation planning and engineering help ease the pressure by devising real-time traffic controls, variable message signs, or other such solutions. Our PhD program in Transportation Planning and Engineering gives you the education you need to join their ranks.  Research-oriented in focus, and intended for students with a desire to advance the state-of-the-art within the field, our curriculum offers concentrations in any of the following:   transportation safety  traffic engineering  transportation planning  intelligent transportation systems   Of course, specialization in areas other than those identified above is possible and can be nurtured with the help of faculty advisors.  Admission Requirements  Admission to this program requires an MS in Transportation Planning and Engineering or equivalent, with a GPA of 3.5 or better (on a 0-4 scale). GRE scores are required for all full-time PhD applicants. Should you decide to take the tests, you must submit the results for consideration. Foreign applicants must take the TOEFL examination and submit the results for consideration.  The “equivalent” of the MS degree can be achieved in several ways. For instance, you may have an MS degree with a different title that covers substantially the same material. More generally, you must demonstrate that you have the equivalent of all undergraduate and master’s level course work in order to pursue doctoral level work in the major area. Further, “equivalence” is evaluated based on the totality of your undergraduate and graduate record, not course-by-course.  Because admission to this program requires a related MS (or equivalent), those of you who have not yet achieved a master’s degree would normally be admitted as MS students. You are expected to earn an MS degree while completing your major and minor course requirements. In rare cases, an applicant with only a BS degree may be directly admitted into the PhD program with the written approval of the department head.  Transfer Credits  Transfer credits for PhD students can be awarded course by course. Alternatively, a MS degree from another institution may be accepted for transfer in toto. In the former case, a maximum of 42 credits of approved graduate work may be transferred. The latter requires a recommendation from the department’s Graduate Committee and the approval of the department head. Transfer credits are awarded generally at the time of admission and must be approved by the academic adviser, the transportation graduate coordinator and the department head.
