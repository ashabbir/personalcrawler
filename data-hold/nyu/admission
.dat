Due to the volume of applicants, we are unable to give you the status of your application or tell you if your application is complete. However, you can check if your application is complete on the SMTS website:http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/request/smts.html   Submitting your application online  To apply, you must use our online application. When using the online application, you can submit all materials electronically.  The online procedure is user-friendly; however, if you have any questions regarding the application process, please view the Application Resource Center's frequently-asked questions.   Note: You must arrange with the Educational Testing Services (ETS) to electronically submit GRE and TOEFL scores (if necessary) to our Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS). Our institution code for the GRE and TOEFL is 2596. You do not need to use a special department code for the GRE.  If you are required to take the TOEFL, this examination requires you to list a department code that is most appropriate for your field of study or you can simply use code 99. However, do not use code 00 and do not leave this field blank. We will not receive your test scores if you report it this way.  To expedite the processing of your application, you may include the unofficial copies of your results on these tests. However, we must receive the official scores from ETS before the admissions deadline.  Applicants should note the following:   Students with a BA/BS degree may apply directly to the PhD program.  There is no NYU or departmental based financial support for master's students.  GRE scores are required for all but non-degree applications.   Mailing address for application support documentation  We highly encourage you to submit your letters of recommendation through the online application system. However, if your recommenders are inclined to send the letters by post, please mail the documents using the instructions below.  via regular postal service:  via private express mail: New York University  Graduate School of Arts and Sciences  Graduate Enrollment Services  P.O.
