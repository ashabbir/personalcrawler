These four courses must include one (and only one) introductorycourse (PHIL-UA 1-5), and one course from each of the department's three groupsof courses:   Group 1: History of Philosophy  Group 2: Ethics, Values, and Society  Group 3: Logic, Epistemology, Metaphysics, Mind and Language   Nocredit toward the minor is awarded for a course with a grade lower than C.  IndependentStudy  A student may register for an independent study course(PHIL-UA 301, 302; 2 or 4 points per term) if he or she obtains the consent ofa faculty member who approves the study project and agrees to serve as adviser.The student must also obtain the approval of either the department chair or thedirector of undergraduate studies. The student may take no more than one suchcourse in any given semester and no more than two such courses in total, unlessgranted special permission by either the department chair or the directors ofundergraduate studies.  HonorsProgram  Honorsin philosophy will be awarded to majors who (1) have an overall GPA of 3.65 andan average in philosophy courses of 3.65 and (2) successfully complete thehonors program. This program consists of the following three 4-point courses(12 points). (Note: of these courses, only the first two may be counted towardthe ten courses required for the major.)  The Junior HonorsProseminar (PHIL-UA 200) should be taken in the spring semester of junior year.It introduces students to core readings in some of the main areas of currentphilosophy and provides an intensive training in writing philosophy. Admissionto this course usually requires a GPA, both overall and in philosophy courses,of at least 3.65, as well as the permission of the director of undergraduatestudies. The department will try to make alternative arrangements for studentswho wish to participate in the honors program but who will be studying abroadin spring of their junior year.  Next,theSenior Honors Seminar (PHIL-UA 201) should be taken in the fall semester ofsenior year. Students begin to develop their thesis projects, meeting weekly asa group under the direction of a faculty member to present and discuss theirthesis arguments. Students also select, and begin to meet separately with,their individual thesis advisers—faculty who work in the areas of students'thesis projects. Entry to this seminar depends on satisfactory completion ofthe Junior Honors Proseminar—or on the special approval of the directors ofundergraduate studies. It also usually requires a GPA of at least 3.65, bothoverall and in the philosophy major.  Finally,SeniorHonors Research (PHIL-UA 202) should be taken in the spring semester ofsenior year. The seminar no longer meets, but each student continues to meetseparately with his or her individual thesis adviser, producing and discussinga series of rough drafts of the thesis. The final version must be submitted bya deadline to be determined, in April. It must be approved by the thesisadviser, as well as by a second faculty reader, for honors to be awarded. Thestudent must also finish with a GPA of at least 3.65 both overall and in themajor—and here no exceptions will be made. In addition, the thesis adviserswill meet after the decisions by the readers have been made and award somestudents highest or high honors, based on thesis quality and other factors(including GPA in philosophy courses).
