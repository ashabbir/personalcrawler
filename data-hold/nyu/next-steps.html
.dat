Confirm your enrollment and reserve housing.  All admitted students should respond to our offer of admission, as outlined in step 4 of the Critical Instructions document in your admit packet. You must pay both your tuition deposit and your Housing Reservation Payment by May 1. Please note: once you have paid your $500 tuition deposit it will not be refunded under any circumstances. It will appear as a credit on your bursar bill once you register for classes. If you later decide not to enroll at NYU, you will forfeit your deposit.   2. Send in Your Transcripts.  Please mail or have the following mailed to:  Office of Undergraduate Admissions New York University 665 Broadway, 11th Floor New York, NY 10012-2339  Final High School Transcript  All entering freshmen should be sure to let their high school guidance office know that they will be attending NYU and make arrangements to have their final high school transcript sent to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to meet our proof of graduation policy. You will not be allowed to register for fall courses and you will be dropped from courses for which you have preregistered if we do not have your final transcript.  International Students: An extension will be granted to students outside the United States whose secondary schools operate on a different schedule.  College/University Transcripts  If you have completed college courses, NYU generally awards credit if the courses were taken at an accredited college or university, if the courses are similar to courses offered at NYU, and if you received a grade of C or better in the course. We do not grant credit for college/university courses taken during high school if the courses were also used to satisfy high school graduation requirements. You should have official college/university transcripts sent to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions as soon as possible after the completion of the course.  Test Scores  NYU awards credit for scores of 4 or 5 on most of the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations, and for grades of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) higher-level examinations. You must have official scores forwarded to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to receive credit. The NYU code for AP scores is 2562.  Advanced Standing From Other Educational Systems  To be considered for possible advanced standing credit from other educational systems, you must submit an attested or notarized copy of your final GCE A-level results, the Relev�� des Notes for the French Baccalaureate, Diploma di Maturita for the Italian Maturita, or the Certificat de Maturit�� for the Swiss Maturit��. Official results should be submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions as soon as they are available.    3. Complete Your Health Requirements.
