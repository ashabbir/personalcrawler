It has recently detected single Influenza A virus invitro, and is pushing its patented Whispering Gallery Mode Biosensor to higher sensitivity in order to detect single HIV virions. By mentoring students from physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering departments, its interdisciplinary fusion forms a unique platform attacking current technological challanges.
