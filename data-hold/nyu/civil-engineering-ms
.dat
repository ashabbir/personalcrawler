The pace strains the built environment, with our shared civic infrastructure — our bridges, dams, airports, and highways, among other resources — nearing capacity levels. Civil engineers respond to the issue by improving existing systems and designing projects that answer the new challenges raised by modern society.  Our MS program in Civil Engineering trains you to join their ranks. You can specialize in any of the following concentrations:   construction management and engineering  structural engineering  geotechnical engineering  environmental and water resource engineering  urban systems engineering and management  highway and traffic engineering   Our program is flexible, and you may elect for a more general course of study by taking 2 courses in 3 areas of concentration.  Admission Requirements  Admission to this program requires you to hold a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from a program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). You also need to have a 3.00 GPA or better. Applicants lacking a BS from an ABET-accredited program in civil engineering (including those possessing undergraduate degrees in other engineering disciplines, engineering science, engineering technology and architecture, or from a foreign university) have their qualifications reviewed by a graduate adviser. Admission may be granted and may include the requirement for additional undergraduate courses to correct deficiencies. These additional courses are not counted toward the MS degree, nor are undergraduate courses included in computing graduate grade-point averages.  If you are an applicant from a university outside the United States, you should take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE advanced tests) and achieve a minimum grade of 700 on the quantitative section. You also must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and achieve a minimum grade of 550/213/79 (paper/CBT/IBT). In rare cases, the department head may waive the GRE and/or TOEFL after a graduate adviser examines the student’s transcripts and interviews the candidate.  Foreign candidates who meet all other admission requirements but who fail to satisfy the TOEFL requirement may be required to take 1 or more remedial courses in English before admission.  Advising  While academic advisers will consult with and advise you, you are responsible for following the departmental rules outlined on these pages and in this catalog, for ensuring that all degree requirements are fulfilled, and for submitting all proper forms and applications. You must meet with an academic adviser when you first enroll and must have a detailed program of study formally approved by an academic adviser before registration.
