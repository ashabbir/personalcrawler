This integration fosters students' understanding of dentistry and its relationship to overall health. Students at NYUCD work side-by-side with outstanding educators, clinicians, and researchers. The College houses sophisticated, state-of-the-art clinical facilities, and offers the largest and most diversified patient pool of any dental school in the nation. Teachers who are also clinicians work diligently to partner with students to enable them to reach their academic and professional goals.  Students from all four years, D1 through D4, are integrated in group practices under the direction of group practice directors. Group practice directors  mentor students in each of their groups toward competency and clinical  experiences with the assistance of generalist and specialty faculty.                                 group practice directory Read More                           Global Outreach Opportunities Read More                                          Academic Programs     DDS Program     Dental Hygiene Programs     Advanced Education Programs     Master's Degree Programs     Certificate Program in Clinical Research     Programs for International Dentists                      Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                    Research     Research at NYUCD     Bluestone Center for Clinical Research     HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)     Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)     NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                    Patient Care     Become a Patient at NYUCD     Emergency Services / Urgent Care     General Dentistry     Pediatric Dentistry     Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery     Orthodontics     Implant Dentistry     Endodontics     Periodontics     Prosthodontics     Special Needs Program     Patient Advocate     Linhart CDE Program     NYU Dental Faculty Practices     NYU Oral Cancer Center     NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                    Quick Links     About Us     Admissions Information     Academy of Distinguished Educators     Interprofessional Education     Current Students     Intranet     Departments/Faculty     Global Reach     News, Publications and Facts     Employment     Contact Us     Directions                                                Connect        NYU College of Dentistry 345 E. 24th Street (corner of First Avenue) New York, NY, 10010      (212) 998-9800                                  NYUCD Facebook Page                NYUCD Twitter Page                NYUCD YouTube Page                NYUCD LinkedIn Page                                          MAKE A GIFT                                                         Copyright © New York University College of Dentistry  Feedback
