This period of time is meant for you to make plans to leave the U.S. You can travel within the U.S., but if you leave and reenter, you may not return as an F-1 or J-1 student. Speak to an OGS advisor if you have further questions.       Travel while on OPT or Academic Training                 Documents to Carry while on OPT  What to bring when you travel internationally while on OPT or Academic Training.                        How to get a new visa while on OPT  When your visa has expired and you're on OPT or Academic Training.          Related Topics                   How to get a travel signature   Getting a travel signature is the same as before but with a shorter timeframe for a valid signature.                            Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean  Special exceptions for F-1 or J-1 students and scholars.                   Traveling with an I-515A  Read this section if you have an I-515A and need to leave again within 30 days.                       Related External Links:   USEmbassy.gov  Apply for a U.S. visa at UStraveldocs.com                                                NYU Footer                       Search              Directory              Campus Map              Events              Contact Us              Site Map              Copyright and Fair Use              Feedback                   Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
