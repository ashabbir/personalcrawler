Chemical and biomolecular engineers are involved with the production of plastics, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, foodstuffs, synthetic rubber and rocket propellants. New technologies, from sensors to the production of bulk chemicals from renewable bio-resources, require the unique skills of chemical and biomolecular engineers.  The School of Engineering's Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering program is accredited by EAC of ABET (www.abet.org) and will provide you with a solid foundation in science and the engineering sciences. You will study advanced chemistry, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer, multi-stage separation processes and other related areas. You will also work with professors who are among the leading researchers in their field.  Graduates may choose from a wide range of activities, including research, process and product development, design and supervision of the construction and operation of industrial plants, technical sales and services, consulting, management and teaching. Opportunities in chemical and biomolecular engineering are virtually unlimited.  Program Educational Objectives  The objectives of our undergraduate program in chemical and biomolecular engineering are to produce graduates who:   Have a solid foundation in mathematics, physical science (including physics and advanced chemistry), and biology  Are well grounded in the fundamentals of chemical and biomolecular engineering including knowledge of the principles of material and energy balances, thermodynamics, transport processes, continuous and stage-wise separations, kinetics and reactor engineering and process dynamics and control as applied to chemical and biomolecular processes.  Have a working knowledge of modern experimental techniques and data analysis.  Have an understanding of and experience with modern computing techniques  Understand how to apply these scientific and engineering fundamentals to the analysis and design of chemical and biomolecular processes.  Understand the social, economic and ethical problems inherent in the practice of chemical and biomolecular engineering.  Are committed to a lifetime of learning.   Student Outcomes  (a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering (b) an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data (c) an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability (d) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams (e) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems (f) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility (g) an ability to communicate effectively (h) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context (i) a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning (j) a knowledge of contemporary issues (k) an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.
