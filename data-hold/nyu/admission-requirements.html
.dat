As of the 2014 admissions cycle, applicants holding a foreign Bachelor's degree in a profession from an accredited school also are eligible to apply.    The minimum prerequisite course requirements noted in the table below must be met. While a broad undergraduate education with a major in a chosen field is acceptable, certain courses beyond the minimum requirements are recommended. Undergraduate courses in the biological sciences are very helpful in laying a foundation for the dental curriculum. Courses such as comparative anatomy, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, genetics, histology, embryology, physiology, sociology, psychology and mathematics are of considerable value in preparation for dental education at NYU College of Dentistry. All prerequisites must be completed prior to enrollment to the dental program in the Fall semester of admission.    Applicants are required to take the Dental Admissions Test as part of the application process.    Letters of Evaluation are required. Applicants must arrange for the submission of either one (1) Letter from a Committee on professional recommendations, or three (3) individual Letters of Evaluation (two of which must be from science instructors who know the applicant personally).    A non-refundable processing fee of $80.00 (USD) is required to complete the application to NYUCD.    For applicants who have a foreign Bachelor's degree from an accredited school outside of the US or Canada, the TOEFL iBT test will be required. Only scores of 100 or above will be considered.
