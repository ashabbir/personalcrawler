Most full-time PhD students have scholarships that cover tuition and provide a monthly stipend. Although admission is highly competitive, we seek creative, articulate students with undergraduate and master's degrees from top universities worldwide. Our current research strengths include Internet and web research, cybersecurity, graphics, visualization, vision and image processing, and theoretical computer science.
