Because computer technology powers the most essential functions of business, industry, government and entertainment, computer scientists have tremendous opportunities for growth and exploration.  The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science is a rigorous program that not only covers fundamental computer science subjects - such as object-oriented programming, computer architecture, and operating systems.  The School of Engineering also offers a BS/MS Program that lets you earn 2 degrees at once . For instance, you can receive a BS in Computer Science and MS in Computer Science, a BS in Computer Engineering and MS in Computer Science, or a BS in Electrical Engineering and MS in Computer Science. Depending on your preparation and objectives, you can complete both degrees in as little as 4 years.  We provide research labs for specialized study in areas such as cybersecurity, a field in which our department has a distinctive strength,with internationally well-known professionals who are active in the cyber security field. In addition, the program’s close ties to our graduate division immerse you in a vibrant, intellectual atmosphere.
