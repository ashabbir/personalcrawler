The majority of entering freshmen are in the top 10% of their class.                              Diversity (Undergraduate)            Our undergraduate student body continues to be increasingly diverse. At NYU, the student body has no ethnic majority. In 2002, international students made up 4% of the total, and in 2012, that grew to 12%. The 2013 freshman class is 18% international from a record-breaking 87 countries.            All 50 states are represented in the undergraduate student body.            In 2012, African American and Latino/a students made up 19% of the freshman class, up from 11% in 2002.            In 2013, 17% of the freshman class are first-generation college students.                                                                                                              Financial Aid (Institutional Aid)            Institutional aid for undergraduates has increased by almost 138% between 2002 and 2012 (from $78,138,160 to $185,828,888), while aid for all students (undergraduate, graduate and PhD students) increased by 134% between 2002 and 2012.                                            In 2002, the average aid award for new freshmen was $8,960, which covered 34% of tuition. In 2012, the average aid award for new freshmen was $23,721 and covered 55% of tuition. The difference comes from increases in financial aid and investing financial aid in a way that awards aid to students who need it most.                              Financial Aid (Pell Grants)            Pell grants, in dollar terms, increased by 142% between 2002 and 2011 (from $8,648,286 to $20,896,467). Pell is an important metric of economic diversity. The freshman Pell Grant population at Yale is 13%, at Johns Hopkins, 12%, at Princeton, 11%, and at Tufts, 10%. The Pell Grant population among all students at NYU is 22%.                                            Percentage of NYU Students Who Receive Pell Grants Compared to Other Institutions                                                            According to the Institute of International Education���s annual Open Doors Survey, NYU sends more students abroad than any other university, ranking number one for the last ten years.  (The IIE survey counts all study-abroad experiences, including those that are shorter than a full semester.)                      Study Abroad (Undergraduate)            The number of undergraduates studying abroad for a semester or more has almost doubled from 2002 to 2013.                                            In 2002 we had 5 Global Academic Centers. Today we have 13 NYU locations away from New York, including our degree-granting campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.                              Class Size            65% of classes have less than 20 students. This percentage has been stable for 10 years even with an increasing student body. The number of sections with 50 or more students has declined from 10 to 9 percent.                              Areas of Study            Over 40 areas of study have been added at the Undergraduate level.

The vast majority were either renovations of existing space or newly acquired space that replaced leased space. University capital investments over the past 10 years have been funded from a combination of university borrowing, philanthropy and working capital funds generated from operations.                      Academic Investments            There was $905 million invested in academic capital improvements across nine schools between 2002 and 2011. Over 50% of the general purpose classrooms have been renovated, replaced, or added since 2006.                                            Over 50% of the general purpose classrooms have been renovated, replaced, or added since 2006.                                                                                    Student Investments              Between 2002 and 2011, there was $628 million invested in student housing and student services. Part of that investment was a move from leased to owned space, which will result in a cumulative cash flow surplus of $275 million over 30 years.

The purchase of 730 Broadway enabled the University to replace 140,000 square feet of leased space with 200,000 square feet of owned space.

Endowment            The endowment for all parts of the University including NYU Langone Medical Center was $3.121 billion at the end of fiscal 2013 ��� an increase of 175%.                       The data below include NYU's Washington Square campus and all NYU sites within the global network, but not the assets and operating results of NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering.            Net Assets            Net assets more than doubled over this period, to $3.6 billion.            Excess of Operating Revenues over  Operating Expenses            The University's Excess of Operating Revenues over Operating Expenses increased from $10 million to $63 million between 2002 and 2013, according to the University's audited financial statements.  As part of the the University's capital budgeting process, the University Board directs that the Excess of Operating Revenues over Operating Expenses be used as working capital in support of the University's capital requirements.  As such, it is annually budgeted for capital maintenance and other projects authorized by the Board.            Cash &amp; Unrestricted Investments            The University���s cash and unrestricted investments increased from $699 million in fiscal 2002 to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013.            Financial Aid            Total disbursements of financial aid increased by 151%, compared with a 105% increase in total revenue from tuition and fees. As a percentage of tuition and fees, financial aid increased from 17% in fiscal 2002 to 22% in fiscal 2013.            Grants and Contracts            There was a 324% increase in grants and contracts.            Instruction, Research &amp; Libraries            The total expenditures for Instruction, Research &amp; Libraries increased by 98% to $1.4 billion. As a percent of total expenditures, this category of expense increased from 57% in fiscal 2002 to 58% in fiscal 2013.                      Auxiliary, General and Administrative, and Institutional Services            The total expenditures for Auxiliary, General and Administrative, and Institutional Services were $577 million in fiscal 2013, an increase over the eleven year period of 62%. As a percent of total expenditures, this category of expense decreased from 29% in fiscal 2002 to 23% in 2013. During the period of major re-engineering of the University���s administrative and auxiliary services (2008 ��� 2010), this category of expenditure decreased by 5%, while Instruction, Research and Libraries increased by 10%.                    Depreciation and Amortization            Depreciation and amortization increased as a percent of total expenditures from 5% in fiscal 2002 to 9% in fiscal 2013.  This reflects the major investments in the University���s physical plant over that time.
