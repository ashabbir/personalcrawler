Further, globalization of finance and insurance combined with the increased role of sovereign states that operate in financial markets and determine regulatory rules are increasingly leading to economic strategies based on political and national agendas rather than just based on market forces. These factors as well as the convergence of insurance, credit risk and their derivatives, and financial risk management are contributing to a need for a comprehensive approach to risk finance.  The Risk Finance track at the School of Engineering addresses these important developments by providing a specialization that bridges theory and practice and prepares students for challenging careers in risk finance, insurance, credit risk and derivatives, and financial risk management.
