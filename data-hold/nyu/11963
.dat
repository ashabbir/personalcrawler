This concentration helps students learn how to fortify Cyber networks, combat threats, and foster “white hat” hacking. Researching systems allows for students to improve real-world systems to make them stronger and securer. This also includes data-driven analysis of privacy and social networks. After graduation, our students often work either in private corporations or in governments.

Nearly 100 students participated in its creation. The purpose of this project is to make cloud computing available to everyone. It's free and provides access to computers worldwide. This project was funded by the National Science Foundation.
