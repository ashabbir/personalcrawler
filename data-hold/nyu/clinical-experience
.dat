At the College of Nursing clinical experiences take place at both the Clinical Simulation Learning Center (CSLC), our “virtual hospital,” the off-campus setting at acute care hospitals and community-based healthcare agencies. The CSLC is an innovative clinical learning environment for our undergraduate and graduate students to practice providing safe and competent nursing care. In today’s complex healthcare system, it is important for students to have the opportunity to practice clinical skills using the most up to date technologies in an environment that imitates the real life patient care setting. In the BS in Nursing program about half of student clinical experiences take place at the CSLC. In the MS clinical programs and post-BS doctor of nursing practice programs students are also provided with clinical experiences at the CSLC, see On-Campus Clinical for more detailed information about the CSLC and on campus clinical simulation learning experiences.  The Office of Academic Clinical Affairs is responsible for ensuring that students meet the health care and clinical site requirements for their clinical experiences. This office is also responsible for securing the appropriate off-campus clinical learning sites and faculty who teach in both on and off-campus clinical. Meeting these health care requirements is critical to your progression through the nursing curriculum.  See Requirements for details on clinical requirements.
