Your first step is admission to the College. For general information regarding admission, including applications, housing, and financial aid information, please contact:   Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339 , (212) 998-4500.  If you have questions about the Department of Computer Science undergraduate curriculum, contact:  Romeo Kumar  kumar@cs.nyu.edu  Program Administrator  Undergraduate Division  Room 323, Warren Weaver Hall  (212) 998-3094  Office Hours:  M-F 10:00 am - 12:00 pm &amp; 2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  At NYU, several other schools offer course work in the study or use of computers including:  Department of Information, Operations and Management Sciences at Stern School of Business, (212) 998-0800; The Paul McGhee Division at the  School of Continuing and Professional Studies (212) 998-7200; Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at Tisch School of the Arts (212) 998-1880; and  Graphic Communications at the Steinhardt School of Education (212) 998-5125. These departments offer a variety of course and degree alternatives for students who seek an understanding of computers directed towards a particular application area. Our courses are intended for students desiring a strong background in the foundations and uses of computing.  Program Overview  Computer science is a practical art that has led to revolutionary innovations in entertainment, the humanities, health, business, the news media, communications, education, scientific research and the arts. It is also a science rooted in mathematics and engineering.  Although it is a relatively young field, computer science has produced many of the advances of modern life that we now take for granted. It has given medical researchers tools to understand and cure diseases, enabled physicists to reshape our understanding of the universe, allowed neuroscientists to uncover the secrets of our brains, and helped biologists decipher the human genome. Computer science has rewritten the rules of the entertainment industry and has transformed the way humans communicate with each other.  A Computer Science degree granted by a liberal arts program is of special value today, as the world increasingly needs graduates who not only possess computer skills, but also apply them in a context of broad general learning. Graduates will be ready to take exciting and demanding jobs in the field or to continue their studies in pursuit of advanced scientific or professional degrees.  The Department of Computer Science is a part of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, a world renowned center for the study of mathematics and computing. As part of the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) at NYU, the department offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, two minors (one in computer science, and one in web programming and applications) and a joint minor in computer science/mathematics. The BA degree can also  be pursued with  honors. Students may combine our degree with others throughout the College to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the  joint major  in computer science/economics and the  joint  major in computer science/mathematics.  The Department of Computer Science also offers a  BS/BE  Dual Degree in computer science and engineering  and an accelerated  master's program available to qualifying undergraduates. Some of our graduating students go on to graduate study (MS or PhD) in computer science at New York University or elsewhere, while others find many career opportunities in industry upon graduation.  The goal of our program is to train students both in the fundamental principles of computer science and in related aspects of information technology. Majors are required to take Foundations of Science and may begin it in their second year. The Computer Science program embraces a rich variety of subjects and provides great flexibility, allowing students to tailor courses of study to their particular interests. Possible concentrations include computer graphics and computer vision, artificial intelligence and machine learning, networking, databases, and software development. Advanced undergraduate students can work on research projects with faculty members engaged in projects of mutual interest.  The minor in computer science is designed primarily for mathematics and science majors whose work will require basic programming skills. The minor in web programming and applications is designed for humanities and social sciences students who plan to use computer application software such as spreadsheets, desktop publishing, multimedia, and Internet software extensively in their careers. More on our minor programs.  The Computer Science program offers non-major courses for students from all backgrounds and fields. Computer science and technology enable students to develop the skills needed to supplement their careers and interests. All levels will be accommodated, regardless of prior knowledge. Those with adequate computer experience may take advanced classes. Students will be introduced to the advancements that are being made in computers, the Internet, and the Web and will gain practical knowledge of this field by exploring programming, Web development, and related technologies. The courses enable students to obtain the essential background to enter this dynamic field and/or to acquire important skills to support your own major.
