To make you a           better thinker, a better programmer, a better language           designer, and to give you a good understanding of current           technology. Our philosophy is to require you to master           core topics and then let you specialize in application           areas of your interest.  Q: How do I    decide which program suits me best?   I'm interested    in computers as a tool to get me a job, but want practical    training only.  Check the courses    and certificate programs in the NYU school of Continuing    and Professional Studies.  I'm interested    mostly in research and teaching.  Try for the PhD,    an extremely competitive program.  I'm interested    in a technical education that balances practical with    theoretical training. Once I'm done, I don't   want to stay in an academic environment.  Advice: Master's    in Computer Science.  I'm interested    in a balanced business/technical education and to learn    skills that will lead me to technical management.  Advice: Master's    in Information Systems.  I'm interested    in a mathematics and scientific computing education but    with applications to industry, e.g. mathematical finance.   Advice: Master's    in Scientific Computing.   Q: How good do           I have to be to get in?  You need strong           GREs, great recommendations, and impressive grades.           Please find specifics in  Admissions Information.  Q: What do I    have to submit to apply?  See            Admissions Information for a list of the materials you need to submit.  It can help speed    your application's progress if all elements of the    application are submitted together; however GSAS will   accept credentials that arrive separately.  Q: What are the    pre-requisites to get in? What if I have no formal    academic background in computer science?  The pre-requisites    are in Admissions Information.  Prospective students    without any background are directed to the PAC (Preparatory    Accelerated Course) program, a two course program beginning    in the fall and ending in the spring, which is designed to    prepare students to begin a master's program in computer    science.  Q: Can I just   take courses as a non-degree student? Do I still have to    apply in the same way that degree students do?  In order to take courses    in the department you must formally apply, whether you want    to pursue a degree or not. Non-degree applications are available through the Graduate School.
