The Bachelor of Science in Construction Management at the School of Engineering is an interdisciplinary program in the Department of Civil Engineering. It will prepare you for a challenging career in the construction industry as a future leader in a dynamic and ever-changing environment.  We cover a broad range of basic and advanced subjects in engineering and construction management, such as planning, cost estimation, scheduling, project management, and construction administration. We will also expose you to the latest applications in construction research and technology. You will have exciting site visits to construction projects led by experienced mentors. We teach you the fundamentals of engineering and construction science, as well as business aspects of construction. Faculty-directed site visits to actual construction projects inform your studies during modern and practical systems integration courses, providing you with valuable field experience under the guidance of knowledgeable mentors.  Finally, case-method teaching uses real-world business examples to demonstrate how general principles apply to specific problems in construction management. The approach is especially useful when examining construction contracts and administration, as well as safety and business law.
