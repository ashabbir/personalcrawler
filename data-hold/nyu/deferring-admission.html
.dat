Students who are approved to defer their enrollment and who satisfy the requirements listed below do not have to file a new application and are guaranteed re-admission for the subsequent fall semester.  Deferred students pay a tuition deposit for the original term of entry, which will be credited to the new term of entry. Deferred students are then considered Early Decision admitted students for the new term of entry. They are expected to re-confirm their intention to enroll when our new Early Decision students are expected to do so in January and are held to the same expectations as our other Early Decision students. In essence, students who are approved to defer their enrollment are committed to enrolling at NYU but are simply making that commitment a year in advance.   Requirements for the Deferred Enrollment Program:   Students who wish to defer their enrollment must sign and return the NYU Deferred Enrollment Request Form by August 1st.  Students may not defer their enrollment to attend another college or university.  Students may not defer their enrollment to apply to other colleges and universities during their time away from NYU. Students who are found to have applied to other colleges and universities during their time away from NYU will have their admission revoked.  Students who are granted approval to defer their enrollment should understand that their approval is contingent upon successful completion of any high school course work in progress at the time approval is granted. A final high school transcript indicating date of graduation must be forwarded to the NYU Office of Undergraduate Admissions immediately upon graduation. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that an official, final high school transcript is received by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.    General Information  Communication with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions  A new admit packet of materials, including a new offer of admission and Candidate Reply Form, will be mailed in December to students who have been approved to defer their enrollment. All students who have deferred their enrollment must confirm their intention to enroll for the subsequent fall by signing and returning the Candidate Reply Form by the deadline indicated in the new offer of admission. A new deposit will not be required. A new offer of admission will not be issued if a final high school transcript has not been received.  Financial Aid  Students who have been approved for deferred enrollment should understand the following:   Students approved to defer their enrollment for one year and who received a financial aid package with their original offer of admission can expect that the NYU portion of their package (i.e. NYU scholarships and grants) will also be deferred and received in full as originally offered. It will not be necessary to resubmit a new CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.    Deferred students must reapply for any federal or state funds that were awarded as part of an original package by completing and submitting a new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the following February 15.   Deferred students will not be considered for new NYU scholarships and grants regardless of their initial package.   Deferred students will not be eligible to re-apply for financial aid if they initially missed the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE deadline during the year they were originally offered admission. Again, deferred students will not be considered for new NYU scholarships and grants.   Students may be approved to defer their enrollment for a second or third year. A student approved for an additional year of deferred enrollment must reapply for all types of financial aid by submitting both a new CSS PROFILE and a new FAFSA by February 15 prior to the fall semester of entry. Scholarships initially awarded at the time of admission may or may not be available for the second year of deferred enrollment. As a result, students deferring for a second year must reapply for financial aid by February 15 by completing the forms above.    Housing  Students who are approved to defer their enrollment will be offered a space in one our NYU residence halls for the new term of entry. Housing is guaranteed for all of our freshmen who meet our deadlines and requirements.  Exceptions  Though approval to defer one's enrollment is typically granted for one year, we do, on occasion, approve students to defer their enrollment for 2 or 3 years. Only students who need to complete compulsory military service or missionary work will be considered for this exception. Students will not be approved to defer their enrollment for 2 or 3 years in advance, and as a result, the second or third year of deferred enrollment must be requested and approved during January of the following year.
