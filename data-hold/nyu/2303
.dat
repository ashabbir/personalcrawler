Program in Global Public Health  Advanced Certificate Programs  Admission Criteria for Advanced Certificate Study       Admission Requirements   All applicants must have a baccalaureate degree in nursing or bachelor’s degree in a non-nursing field together with an associate’s degree in nursing. Applicants to the advanced certificate program in nursing must have a master’s degree in nursing.  Applicants must provide evidence of R.N. licensure and current registration. Students with equivalent international credentials who show promise of scholarly achievement will be considered for admission. A 3.0 undergraduate grade point average, TOEFL or IELTS scores for all international candidates who have English as a second language, a two- to three-page goal statement, two professional letters of reference, and a résumé (including academic or professional honors) are required. Students must submit evidence of successful completion of an undergraduate statistics course and an undergraduate research course. Some programs may require an interview with program faculty. Dual degree program applicants must first be accepted in the M.S. degree program in nursing in the College of Nursing and will then be referred for admission to the M.P.H. in Global Public Health. Prior to entering the specialty courses of a respective nursing master’s program, at least one year of full-time clinical experience as a registered nurse is required for all master’s programs. In addition, Nursing Education requires three years of clinical experience as a registered nurse; Advanced Practice Nursing: Pediatrics requires one year of relevant clinical experience as a registered nurse in pediatrics. All admitted students must complete the NYU College of Nursing Technical Standards for Core Professional Nursing Competency Performance. A health examination and clearance is required prior to all clinical practicum courses.   Back to top    Technical Standards for Core Professional Nursing Competency Performance   All candidates for admission to a Graduate Program must meet the Technical Standards for Core Professional Nursing Competency Performance in order to be eligible for admission to, progression in, and graduation from a Graduate Program at the New York University College of Nursing (NYUCN).   Back to top    Matriculated/Degree Students   Matriculated/degree students are those who have been accepted for study toward a degree or certificate. Matriculation begins with the student’s first registration. A student is not permitted to be matriculated for two degrees or programs at the same time unless she or he is enrolled in a dual degree program. One program will be noted on the student’s transcript—the program from which one graduates.  Students who have been denied admission as matriculants in a particular program may not take courses as a special student in that program.   Back to top    Non-matriculated/Non-degree Students   Non-matriculated/non-degree students are those who have filed a graduate application and credentials showing that they meet the same minimum requirements for admission as a matriculated degree student, including the required 3.0 undergraduate grade point average, and are qualified to take courses but are not degree candidates in the College of Nursing. Approval to register as a non-degree student does not imply or guarantee admission into a degree program.   Non-matriculated graduate students contemplating eventual matriculation for a master’s degree should take note that only 12 credits of course work toward any master’s degree may be completed before matriculation is established for that degree.   Students not intending to matriculate for a degree and who are classified as non-matriculated students must meet the same minimum requirements for admission as specified above.    Back to top    Application Information   A graduate application, which includes a directory of graduate programs, may be accessed at https://app.applyyourself.com/AYApplicantLogin/ApplicantConnectLogin.asp?id=nyunursing  The application must be supported by official transcripts of all undergraduate and graduate credits. A $75 nonrefundable application fee is required of those applying for matriculation or as non-matriculated students.   Back to top    Deadlines   The fall master’s and advanced certificate applications are due by July 1. Master’s applications filed after this deadline date will be processed as time and program deadlines permit. Early application is highly recommended for all applicants seeking financial assistance and housing.  The spring master’s and advanced certificate applications are due by November 1 for those programs that accept students midyear. Master’s applications filed after this deadline date will be processed as time and program deadlines permit. Early application is highly recommended for all applicants seeking financial assistance and housing.   Back to top    Transfer Credit   Permission to study in an institution outside of New York University must be obtained for graduate students from the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs. A maximum of 9 transfer credits may be accepted from accredited colleges and universities only. Course work must have been completed within the last five years with a grade of B or better and may not have been counted toward another degree. Forms for approval of transfer credit are available in the Office of Graduate Programs. All MS transfer credits must be approved by the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs at the College of Nursing by providing the syllabus of the course(s) taken.   Back to top    M.S./M.P.H. Program in Global Public Health   This program offers selected students an opportunity to concurrently pursue the New York University Master’s Program in Global Public Health (M.P.H.) and one of the 10 Master of Science in nursing programs, so that the dual M.S./M.P.H. degree may be completed in three years of full-time study, which represents a savings of one year compared to the length of time required to earn the two degrees separately. The M.S./M.P.H. program ranges from 71 to 90 credits depending on the program combination.   Back to top    Advanced Certificate Programs   The decision to recognize a nurse practitioner specialty for authorization to practice is made on a state-by-state basis. Therefore, students are responsible to check with the appropriate licensing authority in the state(s) in which they are interested in working to determine the status of a particular nurse practitioner specialty in that state.  All programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). Nurse-Midwifery is accredited by the ACNM Associate Director, Education, American College of Nurse-Midwives, 8403 Colesville Road, Suite 1550, Silver Spring, MD 20910-6374; 240-485-1800.   Back to top    Admission Criteria for Advanced Certificate Study   Applicants for the advanced certificate program must hold a master’s degree in nursing from an accredited program (GPA of 3.0); hold a current registered nurse license in New York; have health clearance; have relevant clinical experience; submit a two- to three-page goal statement; and submit two professional letters of reference. Some programs may require an interview with the program faculty. TOEFL or IELTS scores are required for international candidates who have English as a second language.
