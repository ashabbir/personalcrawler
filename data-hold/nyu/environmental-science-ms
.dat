The MS in Environmental science from the School of Engineering provides a strong foundation in the fundamental sciences as well as regulatory environment issues that govern human-natural environmental interactions. The MS in Environmental Science exposes our students to a combination of theory and practical problem solving approaches that can be directly applied in the workforce or provide a strong foundation for advanced graduate studies.  Our program also offers a variety of research and scholarly activities, including natural and urban environmental systems management, food resilient cities, vulnerability mapping, urban water cycle/watershed studies, contamination remediation, climate change impacts on natural resources and anthropogenic interactions,and water and energy supply and demand chains.
