Emphasis is placed on the clinical component with a focus on a broad spectrum of modern esthetic treatment methods.  Admission  Priority is given to applicants with two years of clinical experience. Applicants with less experience are still encouraged to apply.  Objectives  Upon successful completion of the Advanced Program in Esthetic Dentistry, program participants will have a thorough understanding of esthetic dentistry and exhibit clinical competence in the diagnosis and oral health care of patients desiring esthetic treatment. The participants will have the ability to successfully complete a smile analysis, diagnose and recommend a treatment plan that may include components of several oral health specialty areas in order to attain a maximum esthetic result.  Faculty  Participants treat a variety of patients under the close guidance of a diverse and experienced faculty comprised of top practitioners in the field of esthetic dentistry and related fields.  Course Components  The lectures, seminars, case presentations, research and valuable clinical experiences that are offered will further the participant's knowledge and skill level in esthetic dentistry. A great portion of this program is dedicated to hands-on experience in the clinic. Participants will also attend a laboratory course in which they will learn to fabricate several types of esthetic and prosthetic appliances. Residents will provide esthetic treatment in a comprehensive care environment. They will learn successful interpersonal relationship skills to maximize their experience with patients, peers and other health care professionals. While working with patients, they will design and execute treatment plans that will fulfill all esthetic needs, which include but are not limited to porcelain laminates, Invisalign,��� and porcelain inlays and onlays.
