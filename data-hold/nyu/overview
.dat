The program offers instruction in the           fundamental principles, design and applications of           computer systems and computer technologies.  Students who           obtain aÂ Master's of Science in Computer Science are qualified           to do significant development work in the computer           industry or important application areas. Those who           receive a doctoral  degree  are in a position to hold           faculty appointments and do research and development work           at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding           field. Additionally, the department offers a Masters of  Science in           Information Systems in collaboration with the Stern           School of Business. The emphasis in the MS in           Information Systems program is on the use of computer           systems in business. The  Master of           Science in Scientific Computing, just established by           the Mathematics and Computer Science Departments, is           designed to provide broad training in areas related to           scientific computing using modern computing technology           and mathematical modeling arising in various           applications.  Established in           1969 as part of the Courant Institute of Mathematical           Sciences, the department has experienced substantial           growth in its faculty, student body, research staff, and           funding. Research areas include algorithmics,           computational geometry, high-level programming languages,           compilers and compiler optimization techniques, parallel           and distributed computing, design of computer systems,           databases, artificial intelligence, natural language           processing, graphics, multimedia, computer vision,           mathematical programming, numerical analysis,           computational biology and computational           finance.  The core of the           curriculum consists of courses in algorithms, programming           languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database           systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are           offered in many areas such as natural language           processing, the theory of computation, computer vision,           software engineering, compiler optimization techniques,           computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia,           networks, cryptography and security, groupware and           computational finance. Adjunct faculty, drawn from           outside academia, teach special topics courses in their           areas of expertise.  The primary           facility for graduate educational and research computing           is a network of several hundred workstations. In           addition, individual research groups have their own           hardware resources including Silicon Graphics           workstations, MacIntoshes, IBMs, DECs and HPs. Access to           the Internet is provided through a T3           connection.  Each supported           doctoral student has access to his or her own dedicated           Unix workstation. Many other research machines provide           for abundant access to a variety of computer           architectures, including a distributed computing           laboratory comprising 16 Sparc 5s and 16 Pentium           PCs.
