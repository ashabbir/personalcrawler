This goal is achieved by offering the dental student an integrated endodontic experience in didactics, laboratory exercises and patient care with an emphasis on differential diagnosis, emergency care and interdisciplinary treatment.                            meet our faculty Read More                           group practice directory Read More                           global outreach opportunities Read More             PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM                                                                                                                              Second Year                                                                                            Diagnosis of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component)  Endodontics is introduced as part of a multi-disciplinary course.  The course enables the student to record the patient's chief complaint, medical and dental history, as well as extra-and intraoral examination and pulp and periapical tissue evaluation.  The student will be able to differentiate pathosis of odontogenic and nonodontogenic origin.  An essential goal of this course is to present material that allows students to learn the methods for establishing an accurate pulpal and periapical clinical diagnosis.     Management of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component)  This course component introduces the student to nonsurgical and surgical endodontic treatment modalities.  The biological rationale of endodontic treatment is presented.  The use of basic and new methods of instrumentation are introduced.     Complex Restoration I (Endodontic Preclinical Laboratory Technique Component)  A series of laboratory technique sessions introduce the dental student to the fundamental procedures involved in root canal access, instrumentation and obturation.  Each laboratory session is preceded by an instructional lecture covering the goals and objectives for each exercise.  Basic and advanced instruments and techniques involving hand and rotary root canal preparation are included in course exercises.                                                                                                                                                                         Third Year                                                                                            Advanced Endodontics  This course, for third-year dental students, consists of a series of lectures on advanced endodontic topics.  The information presented enables the student to examine, diagnosis and appropriately treat pulpal and periapical disease. Students are also taught to evaluate and treat endodontic emergencies.The evaluation of outcomes in terms of prognosis, possible complications and the restorative phase of treatment is stressed.  Endodontic Clinic  This course provides the third-year dental student with the opportunity to treat patients who require endodontic care under faculty supervision.  Correlations between endodontic biology and fundamental and current treatment modalities are emphasized.                                                                                                                                                                         Fourth Year                                                                                            Endodontic Clinic  This course provides the fourth-year dental student the opportunity to treat patients who have more complex endodontic needs, including selected molars. Interdisciplinary concerns are also a component of treatment planning these cases.    Honors in Endodontics  This course is offered to a small group of highly motivated students with a high level of academic achievement who are particulary interested in endodontics.  This course presents a series of lectures and seminars on advanced and current endodontic topics that incorporate the biology of endodontic disease and the comprehensive clinical management of complex endodontic cases.                                                       POSTDOCTORAL CURRICULUM  &gt; Advanced Education Program in Endodontics             PROGRAMS FOR INTERNATIONAL DENTISTS  &gt; International Program in Endodontics                                         Academic Programs     DDS Program     Dental Hygiene Programs     Advanced Education Programs     Master's Degree Programs     Certificate Program in Clinical Research     Programs for International Dentists                      Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                    Research     Research at NYUCD     Bluestone Center for Clinical Research     HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)     Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)     NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                    Patient Care     Become a Patient at NYUCD     Emergency Services / Urgent Care     General Dentistry     Pediatric Dentistry     Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery     Orthodontics     Implant Dentistry     Endodontics     Periodontics     Prosthodontics     Special Needs Program     Patient Advocate     Linhart CDE Program     NYU Dental Faculty Practices     NYU Oral Cancer Center     NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                    Quick Links     About Us     Admissions Information     Academy of Distinguished Educators     Interprofessional Education     Current Students     Intranet     Departments/Faculty     Global Reach     News, Publications and Facts     Employment     Contact Us     Directions                                                Connect        NYU College of Dentistry 345 E. 24th Street (corner of First Avenue) New York, NY, 10010      (212) 998-9800                                  NYUCD Facebook Page                NYUCD Twitter Page                NYUCD YouTube Page                NYUCD LinkedIn Page                                          MAKE A GIFT                                                         Copyright © New York University College of Dentistry  Feedback
