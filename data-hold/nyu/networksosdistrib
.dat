Shasha    Lakshminarayanan Subramanian   Michael Walfish   Systems and networking research explores how to structure the basic software running on individual computers and how to coordinate between different computers. Significant challenges include how to support increasing numbers of processors in modern computer systems, leverage the many embedded and mobile computing devices, and build services that scale to a global audience.  Robert Grimm is interested in the interaction of programming languages and systems. The focus of his research is on exploring how to leverage programming language technologies for making operating and distributed systems easier to build, extend, and administer. Current efforts include Na Kika, a platform for securely extending web applications and scaling them to a global audience through edge-side hosting, and xtc, a toolkit for making programming languages and their compilers easily extensible. He is using the xtc toolkit to realize the Jeannie language, which combines all of Java and all of C into a new language that eliminates verbose boiler-plate code, enables static error detection across the language boundary, and simplifies dynamic resource management.  Zvi Kedem has conducted research in computational complexity (algebraic complexity, VLSI complexity); computer graphics (surface reconstruction, BSP tree algorithm); database, knowledge-based systems, and data mining (concurrency control, relational discrete event systems, pincer-search algorithm); parallel and distributed systems (parallel algorithms, compilation for special-purpose parallel machines, reliable parallel computations on LANs and the WWW). His research focus is algorithmic techniques for designing computer-based systems.  Jinyang Li's research interests are in distributed systems and computer networks, and information retrieval systems. Large-scale distributed systems increasingly rely on grassroot deployments, as demonstrated by the popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications and community wireless mesh networks. It is difficult to ensure robustness and security in such distributed systems since the hundreds of nodes comprising these systems are typically unreliable, selfish and potentially malicious. One of the goals of Jinyang's research is to design and build reliable and secure peer-to-peer systems and wireless networks.  Dennis Shasha's research interests are focused on three areas: algorithmic and visualization support for computational biology, time series analysis, and tree and graph pattern matching. In computational biology, Dennis Shasha works on tools and algorithms for plant genomics and proteomics research. Time series analysis is needed in many areas ranging from physics to finance to music. Dennis Shasha and collaborators are working on efficient algorithms for performing online windowed correlation analysis on very large time series datasets (thousands or even millions of numbers). Graph pattern matching problems also arise in many areas from XML querying to chemistry; Denis Shasha's group developed a number of algorithms and software tools for various graph matching problems. Dennis Shasha also works on several themes in databases: privacy-protection (when the server cannot be trusted as in out-sourcing cases), database tuning, and testing.  Lakshminarayanan Subramanian's research interests span the areas of networking, distributed systems, security and technologies for developing countries. He is exploring a range of topics including routing protocol design, security issues in routing protocols, quality of service, congestion control, overlay networks and wireless networks. His current focus is on practical security problems in network protocols and distributed systems (enterprise security and byzantine fault tolerant systems) and systems/networking challenges in developing country settings (issues of low cost connectivity solutions for rural villages and how to make distributed systems operate in environments with intermittent power). He is one of the designers of WiLDNet, a lo-cost network deployed in parts of the world from Ghana to Philippines.  Michael Walfish's research interests are in systems, security, and networking. He has worked on untrusted computation, untrusted storage, failure detection in distributed systems, naming, network architecture, verifiable auctions, and denial-of-service defense.
