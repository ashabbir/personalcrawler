What kinds of research opportunities are available to DDS students?                                                                                            The opportunities for DDS student research support NYUCD���s goal of educating dentists who are able to think for themselves, be intelligent users of research, able to critique it, and comfortable with the structure and syntax of modern biomedical science. NYUCD���s term for such dentists is men and women of science.   Entering students have the opportunity to engage in an eight-week summer research program even before they formally enter the DDS program through the Summer Research Experience.  DDS students, working closely with faculty mentors, present their research at national meetings as early as their first year in dental school and consistently win top national prizes for their research.  The Annual Research Days, Student Table Clinic Competition, and Honors in Research course are all excellent vehicles for students wishing to enrich their dental education experience through research training.
