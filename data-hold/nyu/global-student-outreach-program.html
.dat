The Program exists thanks to the sponsorship of Henry Schein Cares, the global social responsibility program of Henry Schein, Inc.            We call it an outreach, when in fact it is an 'in-reach.' While we help others by providing dental care, we help students reach within themselves to identify duty and altruism - qualities that we believe they always had.  - Dr. Andrew Spielman    Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Maine outreach faculty participant            NYUCD's comprehensive global outreach programs offer participants a unique, service-learning experience. These interdisciplinary programs provide faculty, residents and students of dentistry, hygiene, nursing and public health with a well-rounded perspective on access-to-care issues and challenge them to rethink their roles as healthcare providers. Clinical outreach programs provide free dental services to populations facing barriers to oral healthcare including a dearth of dental providers, economic hardship and inadequate health insurance coverage. Students and residents receive hands-on clinical instruction and are exposed to public health issues in dentistry. Post-outreach evaluations have consistently shown a transformational effect on participants, and past participants have noted these experiences as a highlight in their NYUCD student career.
